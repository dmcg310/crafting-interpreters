# Running Clox

```sh
make clean # to remove the generated binary and obj files
make       # to compile the program into a binary
make run   # run the REPL version of the compiler
```

After producing a binary you can provide a lox file as an argument to run the program.

```sh
./bin/main <file.lox>
```
